Hi there, I'm Elliott, and I'm delighted to welcome you to my website!<br></br><br></br>
Allow me to share my journey so far... I have just arrived in London from New Zealand, however it's a bit of a homecoming for me, as I was born in Yorkshire before my family moved to NZ when I was young.<br></br>
My enthusiasm for technology and the exiting opportunities in the UK are driving forces behind my move here.<br></br><br></br>
My educational path has been an interesting one. Initially, I delved into the worlds of chemistry, psychology, and forensic science at the University of Auckland. Three years in the industry as an analytical chemist sharpened my precision and problem-solving ability. However, a desire for a new challenge took me back to the University of Auckland, where I began learning how to code.<br></br>
Through this IT course, I acquired a robust foundation in Java, Javascript, Nodejs, SQL, and Git. Collaborating within a team, we crafted a blogging web application, mindMAPE, which you can try out below!<br></br><br></br>
During the height of covid I transitioned from the lab to the IT team of the scientific analytical services company I was working at. In this new role as a Laboratory Information Management System developer (shortened to LIMS developer), I applied my coding skills to enhance the efficiency of the scientific processes I was already familiar with. This unique blend of experiences underscores my adaptability and diverse skill set.<br></br>
Building upon this foundation, I embraced React and used my free time to construct and deploy this very website you're exploring. Here, you can catch glimpses of personal projects that exemplify my commitment to continuous learning and creative problem-solving.<br></br><br></br>
Beyond academia and career, I'm a diehard sports fan, a foodie, and addicted to learning, all of which comes in handy at pub quizzes!<br></br><br></br>
Thank you for stopping by. Please feel free to reach out about any opportunities you might have that align with my aspirations and skills.<br></br>
<br></br>
Cheers!</p>
